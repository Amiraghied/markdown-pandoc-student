* Install pandoc
* Install editor?

Our lesson today will introduce a new way to write in less time, with less
stress, and in a way that is reusable.  Take a look at this document:

How long would it take to turn this document into a word document, a web page,
and a set of slides?

Open your terminal and type:


Scholarly documents are a critical part of your academic and research workflow,
be they lab notebooks, syllabi, papers, theses, CV's, or blog posts.
How you write (word, latex, text editor) and how thise works are presented are
published (pdf from a publisher) are two separate steps. In our open
publishing workflow we're going to separate writing and formatting in two
separate steps. 

Scholarly publishing requires us to do formatting to clarify
meaning: headings for sections, italics or bold for emphasis, quotes, tables,
code blocks, and citations.  In an open publishing workflow these formatting
elements can also cause behavior changes in how your documents are rendered.

Here are some examples of this workflow being successful...

Run a demo document and get an output...
If problems, handle in break after  basic markdown...
How long would this have taken with a traditional word processor or presentation
program?

By the end of the lesson you should have skills to write a document like this
and generate formatted results.
